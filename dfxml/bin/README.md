# Tools for working with DFXML-files

This directory contains scripts that can be run when the `dfxml` module is installed. Not all of these tools are added to the shell's `PATH` when the `dfxml` package is installed. Instead, these tools should be called in-place, e.g. with `python $PWD/make_differential_dfxml.py`.

## Overview about the provided tools

Some tools are provided as command-line programs when the `dfxml` module is installed.

| Program name            | Short description                                                                  |
|-------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dfxml_cwd               | Fully walk the current working directory and record all files encountered.         |
| dfxml_diff              | Produce a DFXML file denoting file system changes noted by two input DFXML files.  |

Note that some of these tools were previously known as other names when they were standalone files, e.g. `walk_to_dfxml.py` is now available as `dfxml_cwd`.

Tools in the above table have testing written to confirm their command-line functionality.

The following DFXML tools are provided in this directory:

| Script name              | Short description                                                                    |
