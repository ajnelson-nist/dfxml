# Tools for working with DFXML-files

This directory contains scripts that can be run when the `dfxml` package is installed.  Some of these tools are added to the shell's `PATH` when the `dfxml` package is installed.  Others should be called in-place, e.g. with `python3 $PWD/allocation_counter.py`.


## Installed tools

Some tools are provided as command-line programs when the `dfxml` module is installed.  Their source is in this directory, with the suffix `.py`.  The link in this table goes to the tool's documentation and testing directory.

| Program name | Short description |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [`walk_to_dfxml`](../../tests/walk_to_dfxml/#walk_to_dfxml) | Fully walk the current working directory and record all files encountered. |
| [`make_differential_dfxml`](../../tests/make_differential_dfxml/#make_differential_dfxml) | Produce a DFXML file denoting file system changes noted by two input DFXML files. |

## In-place scripts

The following DFXML tools are provided in this directory:

| Script name                | Short description                                                                    |

| `icarvingtruth.py`         | Finds the ground truth in a predefined series of disk images.                        |
| `idifference.py`           | Generates a report about what's different between two disk images.                   |
| `igrep.py`                 | Find files in image, which contain the given string.                                 |
